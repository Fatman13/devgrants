## Event Description

Filecoin testnet has been launched on Dev. 12 (Beijing time). There are many IPFS/Filecoin enthusiastic fand want to
participate, make hands dirty, and learn more about Filecoin. However, it is not very easy to understand the Filecoin 
running mechanism and master the whole mining process. 

This series of lectures is trying to porpularize the filecoin Mining knowledge, and to absorb more people join the testnet, 
and next, have more participation for the mainnet. We think it is important, especially when there are so many people who
had invested into this.

Mainly there will be 3 parts in each events: 1) basic Blockchain and Filecoin knowledge introduction and Filecoin Mining 
Mechanism; 2) Hands-on training on mining software installation, code compiling in a private network; 3) How to connect to
the public network, and basic troubleshooting

We will invite senior engineers who have been working on Filecoin devnet and testnet for a few months as lecturers, and ask
attendees prepare their mining machines (macbook, or linux machine for remote access) before join these events. 

The promotion of this event is mainly in the community and participants who attending our Force-Open Day. We will also post
the event info in Huodongxing (chinese version of meetup).

This event is for nearly free (about $1 needed to make sure people who register seriously), but we need to rent venue, 
prepare fruit、tea and small gifts for our participants, and also traveling fee will be needed.

After the event, we will integrate the materials, including photos, videos, PPTs, meeting records, etc., summarize for 
review, keep and publish records. Also we will regularly survey the ideas, evaluations and improvement suggestions for 
the technical salon.


## Value

This event is for filecoin miners, or developer engineers. THey are very important participants in filecoin ecosystem, 
especially at the early stage. The more people who are interested in filecoin participating in these events，the more miners
will be attracted into the mainnet, and we will see, the more decentralized storage providers.

At the same time, the more people join testnet earlier, the stronger we will expect the network will be before mainnet launchs.


## Request of support

There will be 150+ participants in 3 events. We will maximize the current materials we are using for these events. Aside 
from these,we need to rent venues, specific posters, tea breaks (fruits, beverage, etc.), and traveling fee for lecturers
etc. The cost of the 3 events is approximately $1500.  

In addition, it would be wonderful if we could have some Filecoin T-shirt as awards for outstanding participants, and 
stickers for every one.

joining Filecoin Devnet and Testnet, and keep focusing on Filecoin mining test, spec discussion and issue submitting and code
contribution. 

The most important thing IPFS-Force keeps doing is the weekly IPFS/Filecoin Open-day meet-ups. As from now, there are over
105 meet-ups conducted by IPFS-Force community. The team has a lot of experience on meet-ups and events hosting. And most 
Chinese IPFS/Filecoin fans joined meet-ups held by IPFS-Force. In addition, Steven Li, as the proto-school Shanghai chapter
organizer, with IPFS-Force's sponser, had run 9 sessions of technical salon. All these will be a very strong support for 
the coming events.
