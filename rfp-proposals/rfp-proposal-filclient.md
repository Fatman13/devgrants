# Project Description

We are IPFS-Force team from China with several years' development experience in Blockchain Industry and deep understanding of Blockchain Activities and Actors. With solid experience, we are capable to dive and analyze multidimensional data from blockchain raw data and displayed in creative visualization.

FilClient is a user-friendly light webclient, which you can complete data storage transactions on this client (if lotus has completed this part of the function).We already have an ipfs-based client [forceup](http://www.forceup.cn/#/login) that has been online, which provides us valuable experience, and we are sure to complete this challenge.

## Deliverables

We plan to develop API service using Golang. User use friendly frontend view to select miner, make deal, and send retrieve data.

## Relevant Experience

Our team constantly demonstrate the professionalism on the research of protocol and distributed storage system and actively participate in several Lab seminars of FIL ecosystem. Since Feb 2019, when the Filecoin is open-sourced, several team engineers have been diving into Filecoin studying, coding, and eco-system development. The team have contributed code for several projects in go-filecoin program with tens of PRs, while we pro-actively participate in devnet testing, issues submitting, and discussion of design. IPFS-Force is one of the most active communities in Filecoin eco-system everybody could see from github and slack channel. We have developed several libs and tools which could support FilScan development, that's why the whole schedule could be defined tightly. In addition, our Arch and Devs have seasoned experience of Blockchain and Storage projects, such as High-density Cloud Object Storage, Ethereum, Ulord, aside from Filecoin and IPFS.
