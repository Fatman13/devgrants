## Relevant Experience

Our team constantly demonstrate the professionalism on the research of protocol and distributed storage system and actively participate in several Lab seminars of FIL ecosystem. Since Feb 2019, when the Filecoin is open-sourced, several team engineers have been diving into Filecoin studying, coding, and eco-system development. The team have contributed code for several projects in go-filecoin and lotus program with tens of PRs, while we pro-actively participate in devnet testing, issues submitting, and discussion of design. IPFS-Force is one of the most active communities in Filecoin eco-system everybody could see from github and slack channel. We have developed several libs and tools which could support this project development, that's why the whole schedule could be defined tightly. In addition, our Arch and Devs have seasoned experience of Blockchain and Storage projects, such as High-density Cloud Object Storage, Ethereum, Ulord, aside from Filecoin and IPFS.
