# Project Description

We are IPFS-Force team from China with several years' development experience in Blockchain Industry and deep understanding of Blockchain Activities and Actors. With solid experience, we are capable to dive and analyze multidimensional data from blockchain raw data and displayed in creative visualization.

FilUploads is a tool which support breakpoint resume function when transfer data with GraphSync protocol. This tool will help client transfer data to filecoin miner, specially transfer large data. We have professional filecoin research team to ensure that the understanding of filecoin and follow the lotus in time.

## Deliverables

We plan to develop app with CLI using Golang which can record transmission status and support breakpoint resumable by GraphSync.

FilUploads features:
- Connect to lotus node.
- Choose a local file.
- Transfer data by breakpoint resumable function(user can pause, stop or close app when transfer data and the transmission could be continue when the app is restarted).  


## Development Roadmap
### Milestone 1

1. Solution Research and Design: GraphSync protocol, Interface,  Functions

Resources Requirement:
- 1 Arch
- 2 weeks

### Milestone 2

1. Implementation: All function in [FilUploads features](##-Deliverables)
2. Documentation: User Guide

Resources Requirement:
- 1 Dev, 1 PM
- 4 weeks

*The project progress depends on the completion of the Lotus.*

## Relevant Experience

Our team constantly demonstrate the professionalism on the research of protocol and distributed storage system and actively participate in several Lab seminars of FIL ecosystem. Since Feb 2019, when the Filecoin is open-sourced, several team engineers have been diving into Filecoin studying, coding, and eco-system development. The team have contributed code for several projects in go-filecoin and lotus program with tens of PRs, while we pro-actively participate in devnet testing, issues submitting, and discussion of design. IPFS-Force is one of the most active communities in Filecoin eco-system everybody could see from github and slack channel. We have developed several libs and tools which could support this project development, that's why the whole schedule could be defined tightly. In addition, our Arch and Devs have seasoned experience of Blockchain and Storage projects, such as High-density Cloud Object Storage, Ethereum, Ulord, aside from Filecoin and IPFS.
