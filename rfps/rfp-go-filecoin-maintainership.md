# RFP: go-filecoin maintainership

**Name of Project:** go-filecoin maintainership

**RFP Category:** `app-dev`

**Proposer:** @momack2

## Project Description

We are looking for teams interested in stewarding and improving [go-filecoin](http://github.com/filecoin-project/go-filecoin), one of the [4 current Filecoin implementations](https://filecoin.io/blog/announcing-filecoin-implementations-in-rust-and-c++/). go-filecoin is nearly feature-complete, so you will be starting from a very strong foundation. lotus and go-filecoin achieved interoperability in April 2020, but go-filecoin will need to be updated to bring it back to an interoperable state and to feature-completeness for mainnet launch. 

As the implementation graduates to community maintainership, we are looking for community members able to actively maintain compatibility with the other Filecoin implementations, run and optimize this implementation in live deployments, and ensure go-filecoin continues to be a fully-functional implementation. This is a great opportunity for teams to become strong stakeholders and stewards in the Filecoin ecosystem by building their expertise and engagement. This grant builds on the [previous RFP for protocol implementation teams](https://github.com/filecoin-project/devgrants/issues/43) (see the [full grant specification](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1L7ZZOC4cms3SZNyx7u1Hr0H_XFDUI8FYA2W8dXWBGsY/edit) for details).

In particular, we’re looking for teams that are interested in differentiating the go-filecoin implementation from other Filecoin implementations to drive adoption. Some examples include:
- Making the implementation highly optimized for mining operations
- Building services around the core go-filecoin implementation, e.g. hosting go-filecoin nodes as a service
- Involving the greater Filecoin community in completing the implementation
- We’d love to hear any other direction you think is compelling as well

Note that while this RFP description does not follow the same template as our others, submitted proposals should follow the application format described [here](https://github.com/filecoin-project/devgrants#submit-a-proposal-for-an-rfp).

Please drop any questions at [devgrants issue 140](https://github.com/filecoin-project/devgrants/issues/140).
